// 7L7W - Scala Days 1, 2, and 3
// Due: November 29th, 2017 @ 11:59pm
// Dr. Martha J. Kosa

// Included in this zip file are two folders, each containing solutions to 
// the Days 1, 2, and 3 problems from the 7L7W book. I originally started
// on the assignment using Scala 2.12.4 (current version) and the JDK 1.8.0_151.
// When I reached Day 3's problem however, I realized I had to revert to using
// an older version of Scala/JDK; the version I used specifically was
// Scala 2.7.7(final) and JDK 1.7.0_80. I converted all of my code for 2.12.4
// to work with 2.7.7 (as I had used some features present only in newer
// versions of Scala). I have included both versions of code for each problem
// (except for Day 3) in the corresponding folders labeled with their Scala/JDK version.
